# Email-Validation
This validates that a users email is written correctly and checks the strength of the password.

The program has two different classes, one for the email and the other for the password. The email class verifies that the email has the proper domain by using constructors, setters and getters. The password class verifies the strength of the password by making sure the password has one upper-case and lower-case, a special character, and at least one number.
